### Self-Critique

+++
#### What we did well

+++
#### What we learned

+++
#### What we can do better
- slow to load in some cases, particularly images
- commit numbers need a page to display
- lack of UI indication during filtering or sorting
- filtering/sorting is not applied if user presses back button
- no indication of page number in paginated pages
- very few campground instances
- sparse data; many occasions of "No Info Available"

#### What puzzles us

### PhoneDB Critique

+++
#### What they did well

- thorough sorting system
- many instances

+++
#### What we learned

+++

#### What they can do better
- attributes not labeled on instance cards
- name of long instances cut off
- lack of carousel
- search system seems to match letters
- highlighted search context is sometimes missing
- API is difficult to use because of lack of CORS
