We used Postman to make REST calls to scrape data. Postman is an HTTP client with a GUI that allowed us to make REST calls to the APIs. We can also enter authorization keys and
      HTTP headers to parameterize queries, and view and take the returned JSON data.</p>
      <p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-business-casual">Business Casual </a>template from the <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-casual/">Start Bootstrap </a> site as our site template. This template was released under the MIT license.</p>
